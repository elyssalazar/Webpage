Hello everyone.

This is my first [serious] webpage I've ever made. So I will apologize in advance if it's sucky.

Anway, I will dedicate this webpage to my favorite female fictional character: Charlotte Roselei from Black Clover. I have loved her for years, and I didn't know that I would be so enamored by her. Unfortunately, she's going to have a husband soon. 

I hope you will enjoy this webpage.
